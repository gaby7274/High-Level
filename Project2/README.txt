#How to run

I used vscode with the java extension to run the Proj2.java

#how it works
To select multiple cards you have to hold Ctrl and click the cards.
If the selected cards can be put in a set, you may click
the lay on set button and it will lay a set. The turn does not ends 
until the player lays on stack. 
The computer is dumb.
Other than that, you can draw from stack or deck at first, 
then you may choose to lay on stack to end your turn or lo lay sets.

The game ends with an alert (and you have to close the window) when someone runs 
out of cards or the deck is all done.
